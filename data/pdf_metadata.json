Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19\" century, is called\nclassical physics. Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the 20\" century transformed physics from classical\nphysics to modern\nphysics. Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under\nthe following conditions:\n(1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects\ndealt with must be large\nenough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can\nbe involved. Very small\nobjects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three\nconditions apply to\nalmost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an\nintuitive level.

The second reason\nis that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday\ncircumstances. Modern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories\ndeal with the very fast\nand the very small, respectively. The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By\nexamining how two\nobservers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new\nideas about time and\nspace. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high\nspeeds (greater than about\none percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more\nbizarre is the idea the\ntime for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 15, "text": "Time passes\nmore slowly for an object\ntravelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5\nEarth years if the ship\ntravels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would\nage only 0.5 years during\nthe trip. Einstein's ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous\nexperiments. Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more\nslowly on Earth's surface\nthan for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global\npositioning satellites have\nto correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth\u2019s surface. This is called time\ndilation, and it occurs because\ngravity, in essence, slows down time. Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a\nbowling ball placed on\na trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 16, "text": "If you rolled a marble\nacross the trampoline, it\nwould follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit\nthe ball. Similarly, the\nEarth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause\nobjects to be attracted to\nEarth (i.e., gravity). Because of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time\ncontinuum, as illustrated in\nFigure 1.4. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth's surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose\ngravity is hundreds of\ntimes that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped! Figure 1.4 Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity describes space and time as an interweaved mesh. Large objects,\nsuch as a planet, distort space,\ncausing objects to fall in toward the planet due to the action of gravity. Large objects also distort time,\ncausing time to proceed at a slower\nrate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 17, "text": "In summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and\nspeed are not absolute.

Quantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the\nvery small, namely, the\nsubatomic particles that make up atoms.

Such laws are intrinsic to\nthe universe, meaning that humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover\nand understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle,\ntriumph, and disappointment\ninherent in any creative effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science must\ndescribe the universe as\nit is, not as we imagine or wish it to be. We all are curious to some extent."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 28, "text": "We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what\nwe see. For example, we\nlook up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about\nexploring nature, we\nbecome more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision,\nperform controlled\nexperiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then formulate\nmodels, theories, and laws\nbased on the data we have collected, and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell,\ndescribes the scientific\nmethod that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and\nexperiment. An investigation often begins with a scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern or\ntrend within the\nnatural world. Observation may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the\nscientist may perform some\nresearch about the topic and devise a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes\nhow something in the\nnatural world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an\nobservation. Scientists may test the hypothesis by performing an experiment."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 29, "text": "During an experiment, the scientist\ncollects data that will help\nthem learn about the phenomenon they are studying. Then the scientists analyze the results of the\nexperiment (that is, the data),\noften using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the data analysis, they draw\nconclusions. They may\nconclude that their experiment either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is\nsupported, the scientist usually\ngoes on to test another hypothesis related to the first. If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then\ntest a new and different\nhypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying. Scientific processes can be applied to many situations. Let\u2019s say that you try to turn on your car, but it\nwill not start. You have\njust made an observation! You ask yourself, \"Why won't my car start?\" You can now use scientific\nprocesses to answer this\nquestion. First, you generate a hypothesis such as, \"The car won't start because it has no gasoline in the\ngas tank.\" To test this\nhypothesis, you put gasoline in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis is\nsupported by the\nexperiment."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 30, "text": "If the car does not start, then your hypothesis is rejected.

Modeling\nA model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of\nphysical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations\u2014computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are\nespecially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot\nobserve with our senses,\nsuch as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the\nstructure of an atom using\nmodels, despite the fact that no one has ever seen an atom with their own eyes. Models are always\napproximate, so they are\nsimpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must\nbe. Models put the\nintangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize\nabout."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 31, "text": "Scientific models are constructed based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often\nonly describe a\nphenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena are so complex that they may be\nimpossible to model\nthem in their entirety, even using computers. An example is the electron cloud model of the atom in\nwhich electrons are moving\naround the atom\u2019s center in distinct clouds (Figure 1.12), that represent the likelihood of finding an\nelectron in different places. This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does not show us exactly where an\nelectron will be within\nits cloud at any one particular time. Figure 1.12 The electron cloud model of the atom predicts the geometry and shape of areas where\ndifferent electrons may be found in an\natom. However, it cannot indicate exactly where an electron will be at any one time. As mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations, physical models,\ncomputer simulations, etc. For example, three-dimensional models are often commonly used in chemistry and physics to model\nmolecules."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 32, "text": "Properties\nother than appearance or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used to\nshow how these\nproperties relate to one another. Processes such as the formation of a star or the planets, can also be\nmodelled using computer\nsimulations. Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data, the\nsimulation can allow us to view\nprocesses that happened in the past or happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In\naddition, scientists can also run\nvirtual experiments using computer-based models. In a model of planet formation, for example, the\nscientist could alter the\namount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation. Scientists use models and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design\nsolutions to problems. For\nexample, one way to make a car more fuel efficient is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing\naround the moving car. This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic, such as by using\nrounded corners instead of\nsharp ones."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 33, "text": "Engineers can then construct physical models of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel,\nand examine the flow of\nair around the model.

Scientific Laws and Theories\nA scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been\nstudied.

An\nexample is Pascal\u2019s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases.

A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific evidence and\nverified multiple times by\nmultiple researchers. While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses,\ntheories have withstood more\nrigorous testing and verification than hypotheses. As a closing idea about scientific processes, we want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even\nthose that have been\nsupported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries.

Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements\nScientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a\ndecimal. For example,\nconsider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It\u2019s a rather large number to write out. The scientific\nnotation for this number is\n8.40 X 10\". Scientific notation follows this general format\nx x 10. In this format x is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example\nabove, xis 8.4. The xis\nmultiplied by a factor, 10\u201d, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at\nthe end of a number that is 1o or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the\nfactor is 10\u201c."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 54, "text": "This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in\nplaceholder zeros as you\ngo. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that\nthe actual measurement\nvalue is 840,000,000,000,000. Numbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number\n0.0000045. Its scientific\nnotation is 4.5 X 107\u00b0. Its scientific notation has the same format\nx x 10. Here, xis 4.5. However, the value of yin the 10\u201d factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement\nis a fraction of 1. Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative y. In our example of 4.5 X 10\u00b0, the\ndecimal point would be\nmoved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045. The term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific\nnotation. Quantities that have\nthe same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the\nsame order of magnitude."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 55, "text": "For example, the number 800 can be written as 8 X 10\u201d, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5 X 10\u201d. Both numbers have the\nsame value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99\nwould be regarded as the\nsame order of magnitude, 10\u201d.

You\ncan multiply any number\nby 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply\nmultiplying it by one. For\nexample, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1\nmeter)/(100 centimeters) =1 to\nconvert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 57, "text": "In this case,\nwe know that there are\n1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.

It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct\nnumber of significant\nfigures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can\nsometimes produce\nsignificant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating 5,098 \u2014 (5.000) x (1,010) to obtain a\nfinal answer\nto only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two\nsignificant figures\nin the middle of the calculation changes it to 5,100 \u2014 (5.000) x (1,000) = 100, which is way off.

Graphing in Physics\nMost results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a\nway that is easy to\nvisualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also\nuseful for presenting\nlarge amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way. One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the line graph, probably because it is the best\ngraph for showing how\none quantity changes in response to the other. Let\u2019s build a line graph based on the data in Table 1.5,\nwhich shows the measured\ndistance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two variables, or things that change along\nthe graph, are time in\nminutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have\nperfect accuracy."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 83, "text": "Time (min) Distance from Station (km)\nfe) fe)\n10 24\n20 36\n30 60\n40 84\n50 97\n60 116\n70 140\nTable 1.5\n1.

The vertical axis, or y-axis, shows the dependent variable, the non-manipulated variable\nthat changes\nwith (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the\nindependent variable and\nshould be plotted on the x-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be\nplotted on the y-axis. 2. Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in\nparentheses. Be sure to\nleave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the x-axis. Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis.

In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to\nidentify trends in\nyour data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the\nsmaller and more\nfine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant\nfigures in the axis\nvalues should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements. Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the\nx-axis until you find\nthe 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the y-axis, and\napproximate where 22 km is\nalong the y-axis. Place a dot at this location.

Analyzing a Graph Using Its Equation\nOne way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its trend line. If the graph\nproduces a straight line, the\nequation of the trend line takes the form\ny=mxt+b. The bin the equation is the y-intercept while the m in the equation is the slope. The y-intercept tells you\nat what y value the line\nintersects the y-axis. In the case of the graph above, the y-intercept occurs at 0, at the very beginning of\nthe graph. The\ny-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the y-axis the plot line begins. The m in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or\ndown on the y-axis along\nthe line\u2019s length. The slope is found using the following equation\nY \u2014Y;\nm= \u2014\u2014\u2014.

One\nquadratic relationship in\nphysics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to\ndetermine the force needed to\nkeep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the inverse relationship, in\nwhich one variable\ndecreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb's law.

In a logarithmic scale,\nthe value each mark labels\nis the previous mark\u2019s value multiplied by some constant.

(Domenico Tintoretto)\nThe idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known\nfor hundreds of years. The\n17\"*-century astronomer Galileo Galilei (Figure 2.3) was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the\nfollowing thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction\nalong a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend\nthis thought experiment\nby also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether\nthe ship is moving? Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a\nperson on shore describe the\nmotion of one relative to the other."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 140, "text": "In addition, their descriptions of motion would be identical.

So the actual graph\nwould be curved on either\nend, but let\u2019s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway. TIPS FOR SUCCESS\nIt is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be neglected, as we\nsee here. This is\nbecause it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of\nshort-cuts, as well. It\nworks out because usually the thing being neglected is small enough that it does not significantly affect\nthe answer. In the\nearlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very\nsmall compared to the\ntotal time traveled. Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the\ncar\u2019s motion\u2014the way to\nschool and the way back.

Second, if we\nhave a straight-line\nposition-time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There\nare a few other\ninteresting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can\nuse a velocity vs. time\ngraph to determine position. We know that v=d/t. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation,\nwe see thatd =v X \u00a2. In\nFigure 2.16, we have velocity on the y-axis and time along the x-axis.

If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get -5 km. If we add them together, we see that the net\ndisplacement for the\nwhole trip is o km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place. TIPS FOR SUCCESS\nYou can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a km/km=1 (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good\nbecause it can tell us\nwhether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with m ~\ns for velocity instead\nof m/s, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called\ndimensional\nanalysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics. The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether\nthe car is speeding up. In\nour earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 182, "text": "Graphically,\nyou can see that the\nslope of these two lines is 0.

Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we\ncan also define one for a\nvelocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, a.

CHAPTER 3\nAcceleration\nFigure 3.1 A plane slows down as it comes in for landing in St. Maarten. Its acceleration is in the opposite\ndirection\nof its velocity. (Steve Conry, Flickr)\nChapter Outline\n3.1 Acceler\nation with Equations and Graphs\nINTRODUCTION You may have heard the term accelerator, referring to the gas pedal in a car. When the\ngas pedal is pushed\ndown, the flow of gasoline to the engine increases, which increases the car\u2019s velocity. Pushing on the gas\npedal results in\nacceleration because the velocity of the car increases, and acceleration is defined as a change in\nvelocity. You need two quantities\nto define velocity: a speed and a direction. Changing either of these quantities, or both together,\nchanges the velocity. You may\nbe surprised to learn that pushing on the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel also causes\nacceleration. The first reduces the\nspeed and so changes the velocity, and the second changes the direction and also changes the velocity. In fact, any change in velocity\u2014whether positive, negative, directional, or any combination of these\u2014is\ncalled an acceleration in\nphysics."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 225, "text": "The plane in the picture is said to be accelerating because its velocity is decreasing as it\nprepares to land.

The\nmagnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a\ngreater rate in the first\nsecond of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous\naccelerations at all times to\ncalculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity\nminus the initial velocity) and\nthe change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. Note that the\naverage acceleration can be\npositive, negative, or zero. A negative acceleration is simply an acceleration in the negative direction."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 227, "text": "Keep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the change in velocity, it is not\nalways in the direction of\nthe velocity itself.

His laws of motion were just one part\nof the monumental\nwork that has made him legendary. The development of Newton's laws marks the transition from the\nRenaissance period of\nhistory to the modern era. This transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people\nthought about the\nphysical universe. Drawing upon earlier work by scientists Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, Newton's\nlaws of motion allowed\nmotion on Earth and in space to be predicted mathematically.

Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a\ndolphin jumping out of\nthe water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but\nkinematics describes only\nthe way objects move\u2014their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect\nthe motion of moving\nobjects and systems. Newton's laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the\nway objects speed up,\nslow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also universal laws: they apply\neverywhere on Earth as well\nas in space. A force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a\ntable, or an animate object, a\nperson."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 272, "text": "The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces\nhave different\nmagnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in\ndifferent directions. For\nexample, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a\nmosquito landing on your\narm exerts only a small force on your arm. When multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on\nan object gives the total\nforce, or net force. An external force is a force that acts on an object within the system from outside the\nsystem. This type of\nforce is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the\nsystem. The net external force\ncombines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about\nnet force, external force,\nand net external force in the coming sections. In mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or\nnegative). By convention, the\nnegative sign is assigned to any movement to the left or downward."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 273, "text": "If two forces pushing in opposite\ndirections are added\ntogether, the larger force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite\ndirection. It is important to\nbe consistent with your chosen coordinate system within a problem; for example, if negative values are\nassigned to the\ndownward direction for velocity, then distance, force, and acceleration should also be designated as\nbeing negative in the\ndownward direction. Free-Body Diagrams and Examples of Forces\nFor our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the\nopportunity to introduce a\nuseful tool known as a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram represents the object being acted\nupon\u2014that is, the free\nbody\u2014as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are\nrepresented by vectors\n(which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting\non the body affect its\nmotion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as\nexplained in the section on\nNewton's third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an\nobject."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 274, "text": "ALVA ALAA AAAS\na ~<\u2018_\n\u2014\u2014_ i\nT Free-body diagram\nWw\nFigure 4.2 An object of mass, m, is held up by the force of tension.

The forces are\nindicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow\npointing down,\nrepresenting gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or\nstrength) of the forces. Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal\nlengths in Figure 4.2, which\nmeans that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal\nmagnitude act in opposite\ndirections, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero. Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical\ncontact, such as the pull\nof a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational\nforce)."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 275, "text": "In the next three sections discussing Newton's laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of\nforces: friction, the\nnormal force, and the gravitational force.

At first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You have probably noticed\nthat a moving object will\nusually slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding\nwhy, for example, a sliding\nbox slows down (seemingly on its own) is to first understand that a net external force acts on the box to\nmake the box slow down. Without this net external force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in\nNewton's first law of motion). What force acts on the box to slow it down? This force is called friction. Friction is an external force that\nacts opposite to the\ndirection of motion (see Figure 4.3). Think of friction as a resistance to motion that slows things down. Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before\nfriction slows it to a stop."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 278, "text": "However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly, so the puck experiences very little friction as\nit moves over the\nsurface. With friction almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed. On a\nfrictionless surface, the\npuck would experience no net external force (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally, if we know\nenough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects will slow down. Now let\u2019s think about another example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by\napplying a force of\n+50 N. (The positive sign indicates that, by convention, the direction of motion is to the right.) What is\nthe force of friction that\nopposes the motion? The force of friction must be -50 N. Why? According to Newton's first law of\nmotion, any object moving at\nconstant velocity has no net external force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting\non the object must be\nzero. The mathematical way to say that no net external force acts on an object is Free = O or ZF = 0."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 279, "text": "So\nifthe man applies +50\nN of force, then the force of friction must be -so N for the two forces to add up to zero (that is, for the\ntwo forces to cancel each\nother).

The normal force is\nthe force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object in response to gravity pulling the object down.

In fact, the inertia of an object is proportional to\nthe mass of the object. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter (or stuff) in an object. The quantity or amount of matter in\nan object is determined by\nthe number and types of atoms the object contains.

Most real-\nworld physics problems\n(such as with the game of pool pictured here) are, after all, either two- or three-dimensional problems\nand physics is most useful\nwhen applied to real physical scenarios. We start by learning the practical skills of graphically adding and\nsubtracting vectors (by\nusing drawings) and analytically (with math). Once we're able to work with two-dimensional vectors, we\napply these skills to\nproblems of projectile motion, inclined planes, and harmonic motion. 5.1 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods\nSection Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\ne Describe the graphical method of vector addition and subtraction\ne Use the graphical method of vector addition and subtraction to solve physics problems\nSection Key Terms\ngraphical method head (of a vector) head-to-tail method resultant\nresultant vector tail vector addition vector subtraction\nThe Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction\nRecall that a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction.

Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that\nis backward, to the left,\nor downward is usually considered to be negative (-). In two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and\nhorizontal. For vertical and\nhorizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional\nproblem, one of the\ncomponents simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a\nframe of reference such as\na coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an\narrow having a length\nproportional to the vector\u2019s magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points. Figure 5.2 shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a\ncity. The person first\nwalks nine blocks east and then five blocks north.

A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector,\nbut points in the\nopposite direction (as shown in Figure 5.6). Subtracting the vector B from the vector A, which is written\nas A - B, is the same as\nA+(-B). Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, A - B is also equal to (-B) + A.

Using the Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve\nPhysics Problems\nNow that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to\ngraphically determine the\nresultant vector, which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters\npushing a third as seen\nin Figure 5.7. Free body diagram\n(a) (b)\nFigure 5.7 Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and\nadd like vectors, so the total force\non the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the\nforces acting on the third skater. In problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making\nthe length of the vectors\nproportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each\ncentimeter of vector length\ncould represent 50 N worth of force."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 352, "text": "Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use\nthe head-to-tail method\nto draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to\nthe original units using the\nscale you created. You can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in Figure 5.7 that the two skaters are\npushing on the third skater\nwith equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that\nthe forces are not equal\nbecause they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of 400 N, then we\nwould find the magnitude\nof the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a\nright angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c,\nthe Pythagorean theorem\ntells us that\nty ac\nc= Va +b. Applying this theorem to the triangle made by F,, F,, and F,o, in Figure 5.7, we get\nFa = YA +R. or\nFiot = /(400 N)\u201d + (400 N)? = 566N."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 353, "text": "Note that, if the vectors were not at a right angle to each other (90\u00b0 to one another), we would not be\nable to use the\nPythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Another scenario where adding\ntwo-dimensional vectors is\nnecessary is for velocity, where the direction may not be purely east-west or north-south, but some\ncombination of these two\ndirections. In the next section, we cover how to solve this type of problem analytically. For now let\u2019s\nconsider the problem\ngraphically.

The angle of\nrotation A@ is the arc length divided by the radius of curvature. The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the radian. (Radians are actually\ndimensionless, because a radian\nis defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.)

Tangential velocity is the instantaneous\nlinear velocity of an\nobject in rotational motion. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential\nvelocity, consider again a pit\non the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length (As) ina short time (Af) so its tangential speed is\nAs P\nv=: 3\nAt\nFrom the definition of the angle of rotation, AQ = As, we see that As = rA@.

Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity, @,\nwill produce a greater\nlinear (tangential) velocity, v, for the car.

The difference in wind\nspeeds between the strong cold winds higher up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds\ntraveling north from the\nGulf of Mexico causes the column of rotating air to shift so that it spins around a vertical axis, creating a\ntornado."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 490, "text": "Tornadoes produce wind speeds as high as 500 km/h (approximately 300 miles/h), particularly at the\nbottom where the funnel is\nnarrowest because the rate of rotation increases as the radius decreases.

Torque\nIf you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to\nchange angular velocity. The\nfarther the force is applied from the pivot point (or fulcrum), the greater the angular acceleration. For\nexample, a door opens\nslowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore,\nwe know that the more\nro)\nChapter 6 e Circular and Rotational Motion\nmassive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely\nproportional to mass. These\nrelationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton's\nsecond law of motion. Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder\nwhat the angular version of\nforce is, and how it relates to linear force. The angular version of force is torque T, which is the turning effectiveness of a force.

Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is,\nthe slower it accelerates for\nthe same torque.

Newscasters speak of sports teams or politicians gaining, losing, or maintaining the\nmomentum to win. As we\nlearned when studying about inertia, which is Newton's first law of motion, every object or system has\ninertia\u2014that is, a\ntendency for an object in motion to remain in motion or an object at rest to remain at rest. Mass is a\nuseful variable that lets us\nquantify inertia. Momentum is mass in motion. Momentum is important because it is conserved in isolated systems; this fact is convenient for solving\nproblems where objects\ncollide. The magnitude of momentum grows with greater mass and/or speed. For example, look at the\nfootball players in the\nphotograph (Figure 8.1). They collide and fall to the ground. During their collisions, momentum will play\na large part."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 575, "text": "In this\nchapter, we will learn about momentum, the different types of collisions, and how to use momentum\nequations to solve collision\nproblems. 8.1 Linear Momentum, Force, and Impulse\nSection Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\ne Describe momentum, what can change momentum, impulse, and the impulse-momentum theorem\ne Describe Newton's second law in terms of momentum\ne Solve problems using the impulse-momentum theorem\nSection Key Terms\nchange in momentum impulse impulse-momentum theorem linear momentum\nMomentum, Impulse, and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem\nLinear momentum is the product of a system's mass and its velocity.

Therefore, the\ngreater an object\u2019s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving\nobject has greater\nmomentum than a smaller, slower object."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 576, "text": "Momentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity v. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is\nin a negative direction\n(i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when\nvelocity is in a positive\ndirection, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s. Momentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by\nphysicists such as Newton. Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton's second law of motion to show the\nrelationship between force and\nmomentum. Recall our study of Newton's second law of motion (Fret = ma). Newton actually stated his second law of\nmotion in terms of\nmomentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time\nover which it changes. The\nchange in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum. In equation form, this law is\nky= =e\nnet =\nAt\u2019\nwhere Fy,\u00a2; is the net external force, Ap is the change in momentum, and At is the change in time."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 577, "text": "We can solve for Ap by rearranging the equation\nA\nFret = =\nto be\nAp = Fyet At.

From the\nequation, we see that\nthe impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the\nchange in momentum. The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept\nbecause it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great\neffect on the momentum of\nan object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball.

For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you\nchoose the earth as your\nframe of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky. Light is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are\ninconsistent with Galileo's and\nNewton's explanation of relativity.

It was known to\ntravel as waves, and all other\ntypes of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed\nthat space was filled with\nan invisible medium that light waves traveled through.

How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare\nwith the elapsed time\nmeasured for the same event by a person on the earth?

Since heat,\nlike work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J). Atoms and molecules are constantly in motion, bouncing off one another in random directions.

In these ways, energy can\nbe converted into other\nforms of energy in other systems. For example, a car engine burns fuel for heat transfer into a gas. Work\nis done by the gas as it\nexerts a force through a distance by pushing a piston outward."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 822, "text": "This work converts the energy into a\nvariety of other forms\u2014into\nan increase in the car\u2019s kinetic or gravitational potential energy; into electrical energy to run the spark\nplugs, radio, and lights;\nand back into stored energy in the car\u2019s battery. But most of the thermal energy transferred by heat\nfrom the fuel burning in the\nengine does not do work on the gas. Instead, much of this energy is released into the surroundings at\nlower temperature (i.e.,\nlost through heat), which is quite inefficient. Car engines are only about 25 to 30 percent efficient. This\ninefficiency leads to\nincreased fuel costs, so there is great interest in improving fuel efficiency. However, it is common\nknowledge that modern\ngasoline engines cannot be made much more efficient. The same is true about the conversion to\nelectrical energy in large power\nstations, whether they are coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear powered. Why is this the case? The answer lies in the nature of heat. Basic physical laws govern how heat transfer for doing work takes\nplace and limit the\nmaximum possible efficiency of the process.

You may be wondering at this point, why the wacky name? Shouldn't this be called the first law of\nthermodynamics rather than\nthe zeroth? The explanation is that this law was discovered after the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics but is so\nfundamental that scientists decided it should logically come first.

The need for energy creates quite a bit of demand for thermodynamics engineers, because both\ntraditional energy companies\nand alternative (green) energy startups rely on interactions between heat and work and so require the\nexpertise of\nthermodynamics engineers.

In the game of 52\npickup, the prankster tosses an entire deck of playing cards onto the floor, and you get to pick them up. In the process of picking\nup the cards, you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly\nstate in the deck is much\ngreater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains\nconstant in any\nspontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers\nenergy spontaneously from\nhigher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. This is because\nentropy increases for\nheat transfer of energy from hot to cold (Figure 12.9)."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 851, "text": "Because the change in entropy is Q/T, there is a\nlarger change in AS at\nlower temperatures (smaller 1).

Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is no more temperature difference left to drive\nenergy transfer by heat\nand therefore to do work. The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work. Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured.

Some oscillations create waves, such as the sound\nwaves created by plucking a\nguitar string. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles,\nsuch as electrons, can\nbehave like waves. You can make water waves in a swimming pool by slapping the water with your\nhand. Some of these waves,\nsuch as water waves, are visible; others, such as sound waves, are not. But every wave is a disturbance\nthat moves from its source\nand carries energy. In this chapter, we will learn about the different types of waves, their properties,\nand how they interact with\none another."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 906, "text": "13.1 Types of Waves\nSection Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:\ne Define mechanical waves and medium, and relate the two\ne Distinguish a pulse wave from a periodic wave\ne Distinguish a longitudinal wave from a transverse wave and give examples of such waves\nSection Key Terms\nlongitudinal wave mechanical wave medium wave\nperiodic wave pulse wave transverse wave\nMechanical Waves\nWhat do we mean when we say something is a wave? A wave is a disturbance that travels or propagates\nfrom the place where it\nwas created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any\nmass. Light, sound, and\nwaves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are mechanical waves;\nmeaning, they require a\nmedium to travel through. The medium may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave\ndepends on the material\nproperties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can\ntravel through a vacuum\nsuch as the empty parts of outer space."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 907, "text": "A familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the\nsurface of the water, an\nexample of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the\nwater surface\nrepeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which\nis when the oscillating\ncone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances,\nwhich include the\ndisturbance of Earth's surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves\nare most easily\nunderstood using an analogy with water waves.

The Richter scale\nrating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd\nClass Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)\nGeologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave\ndisturbances, including\ndisturbance of Earth\u2019s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves\nare similar to surface\nwaves on water. The waves under Earth's surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in\nan earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-\nwaves). These two types of\nwaves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the\nmedium through which\nthey are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the\nspeed of S-waves."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 922, "text": "Both\ncomponents of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have\nspeeds of 4 to 7 km/s,\nand S-waves have speeds of 2 to5 km/s, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets\nprogressively farther ahead\nof the S-wave as they travel through Earth's crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P-\nand S-waves is used to\ndetermine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake. We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves\ncannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth's core. In contrast, compression or\nlongitudinal waves can\npass through a liquid and they do go through the core.

Reflection and Refraction of Waves\nAs we saw in the case of standing waves on the strings of a musical instrument, reflection is the change\nin direction of a wave\nwhen it bounces off a barrier, such as a fixed end. When the wave hits the fixed end, it changes\ndirection, returning to its source. As it is reflected, the wave experiences an inversion, which means that it flips vertically. If a wave hits\nthe fixed end with a crest,\nit will return as a trough, and vice versa (Henderson 2015). Refer to Figure 13.17. Fixed end Fixed end\nIncident pulse | Inverted reflected |\nSee Pulse\n| a\nFigure 13.17 A wave is inverted after reflection from a fixed end. TIPS FOR SUCCESS\nIf the end is not fixed, it is said to be a free end, and no inversion occurs."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 936, "text": "When the end is loosely\nattached, it reflects without\ninversion, and when the end is not attached to anything, it does not reflect at all. You may have noticed\nthis while changing\nthe settings from Fixed End to Loose End to No End in the Waves on a String PhET simulation. Rather than encountering a fixed end or barrier, waves sometimes pass from one medium into another,\nfor instance, from air\ninto water. Different types of media have different properties, such as density or depth, that affect how\na wave travels through\nthem. At the boundary between media, waves experience refraction\u2014they change their path of\npropagation. As the wave bends,\nit also changes its speed and wavelength upon entering the new medium. Refer to Figure 13.18. Figure 13.18 A wave refracts as it enters a different medium. For example, water waves traveling from the deep end to the shallow end of a swimming pool\nexperience refraction. They bend\nin a path closer to perpendicular to the surface of the water, propagate slower, and decrease in\nwavelength as they enter\nshallower water. Check Your Understanding\n13.

The answer to\nthis old philosophical question depends on how you define sound. If sound only exists when someone is\naround to perceive it,\nthen the falling tree produced no sound.

This is a sound wave. Consequently, if a tree collided with another object in space, no one\nwould hear it, because no\nsound would be produced. This is because, in space, there is no air, water or other matter to be\ndisturbed and produce sound\nwaves. In this chapter, we'll learn more about the wave properties of sound, and explore hearing, as\nwell as some special uses for\nsound.

A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3, and Figure 14.4. As\nthe string oscillates back\nand forth, part of the string\u2019s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This\ncreates slightly higher and\nlower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are\nrarefactions. The pressure\ndisturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of\nthe energy is lost in the\nform of thermal energy transferred to the air.

The graph shows gauge pressure (Pgauge) versus distance x from the source. Gauge pressure is\nthe pressure relative to atmospheric\npressure; it is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it. For ordinary, everyday sounds,\npressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure. The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave\nis spread over a larger\nand larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in Figure 14.5,\nand some of the energy is\nconverted to thermal energy in the air.

A complicated mechanism\nconverts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain. The Speed of Sound\nThe speed of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of\nsound in a medium is\ndetermined by a combination of the mediun\u2019s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The\nmore rigid (or less\ncompressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the\nslower the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 967, "text": "Because liquids and solids are relatively\nrigid and very difficult to\ncompress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases.

These folds\nopen and close rhythmically, creating a pressure buildup. As air travels up and past the vocal cords, it\ncauses them to vibrate. This vibration escapes the mouth along with puffs of air as sound.

You may\nhave noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of\nhuman hearing. Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. The\nperception of frequency is called\npitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness.

(John Norton)\nYet another way that people make sounds is through playing musical instruments (see the previous\nfigure). Recall that the\nperception of frequency is called pitch. You may have noticed that the pitch range produced by an\ninstrument tends to depend\nupon its size."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 990, "text": "Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while larger\ninstruments, such as a tuba,\ntypically make low-pitch sounds. High-pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical\ninstrument is directly related to\nthe wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds, just as a\nlarge instrument creates\nlong-wavelength sounds. Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a\ndifferent frequency from another. We can usually distinguish one sound from another if the frequencies of the two sounds differ by as\nlittle as 1 Hz. For example,\n500.0 and 501.5 Hz are noticeably different. Musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments, and are the building\nblocks of a song. In\nWestern music, musical notes have particular names, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat. Some people can\nidentify musical notes just\nby listening to them. This rare ability is called perfect, or absolute, pitch. When a violin plays middle C, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is\nthat each instrument\nproduces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 991, "text": "We call our perception of these combinations\nof frequencies and\nintensities the timbre of the sound.

Let\u2019s compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a\nstationary source (Figure\n14.14), sound waves emitted by a moving source (Figure 14.15), and sound waves emitted by a\nstationary source but heard by\nmoving observers (Figure 14.16). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was\nemitted. If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and\nfrequency as emitted by\nthe source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air\ncompressions (crests) become\ncloser together in the direction in which it\u2019s traveling and farther apart in the direction it\u2019s traveling\naway from.

The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the\nfrequency is reduced. Figure 14.16 The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion\ntoward the source increases frequency\nas the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 996, "text": "Motion away\nfrom the source decreases\nfrequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary. We know that wavelength and frequency are related by v = fA, where vis the fixed speed of sound. The\nsound moves in a\nmedium and has the same speed vin that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore,\nfmultiplied by A is a\nconstant. Because the observer on the right in Figure 14.15 receives a shorter wavelength, the\nfrequency she perceives must be\nhigher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower\nfrequency. The same thing happens in Figure 14.16. A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward\nthe source, and a lower\nfrequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source.

Of course, we can also make the reverse\ncalculation if we know the\ntime it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many\nyears for its light to reach\nus. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact,\nno longer exist. Very\nlarge distances in the universe are measured in light years."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1083, "text": "One light year is the distance that light\ntravels in one year, which is\n9.46 x 10! kilometers or 5.88 x 10! * miles (..and 10\u201d isa trillion\u2019). A useful equation involving c is\nc=fr 15.1\nwhere fis frequency in Hz, and A is wavelength in meters.

Be sure you keep track of the + and - exponents\ncorrectly. Checking\nback to the diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum in the previous section shows that 10\u201c is a\nreasonable order of magnitude\nfor the frequency of yellow light. The frequency of a wave is proportional to the energy the wave carries. The actual proportionality\nconstant will be discussed in a\nlater chapter."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1084, "text": "Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, we also know that wavelength is\ninversely proportional to\nenergy. Keep these relationships in mind as general rules. The rate at which light is radiated from a source is called luminous flux, P, and it is measured in lumens\n(Im). Energy-saving\nlight bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of\nthese bulbs is called a\ncompact fluorescent lamp; another is an LED (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old\nincandescent bulb with\nan energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To\ncompare bulbs accurately,\nyou would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage\u2014that is, the electric\npower used\u2014would be\nmisleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging. The luminous flux of a bulb might be 2,000 Im. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions.

In\nthis section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection. Whenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected\nlight travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, 0, , equals\nthe angle of incidence, 6;\n.

Some four decades\nlater, Einstein\u2019s idea found application in a process called, light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation. Take the first\nletters of all the words (except by and \u201cof\u201d) and write them in order. You get the word Iaser (see (a)),\nwhich is the name of the\ndevice that produces such a beam of light. Laser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These\nproperties lead to a number of\napplications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples:\n- This chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see ).

Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators\u2014\ndevices that separate the\nvarious wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are\nused, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples.

The equation\nshows how to the wavelength in a given medium, Jy, is related to the wavelength in a vacuum, A, and\nthe refractive index, n, of\nthe medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser\nbeam in various media. The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the\ndiscussion of double slits in\nYoung's double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle 0\nrelative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far\naway. The rays start in\nphase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the\npath lengths traveled."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1245, "text": "Each ray travels a distance that differs by d sin 0 from that of its neighbor, where dis the distance\nbetween slits.

Electric charge\ncomes in two varieties, which we call positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and unlike\ncharges attract each other. Thus, two positive charges repel each other, as do two negative charges. A positive charge and a\nnegative charge attract each\nother. How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in\ncontrolled ways, certain\ncombinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of\nthe opposite type on the\nother material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For\nexample, when glass is rubbed\nwith silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk\nhave opposite charges,\nthey attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods rubbed with\nsilk in this manner will\nrepel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1273, "text": "Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this\nmanner will repel each\nother, because both cloths have negative charge.

It took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word electric\nitself comes from the\nGreek word elektron for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur,\nattracts dry straw. Almost\n2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of\nelectric charge as being due\nto a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for\nseveral hundred years,\nbut it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. Thomson and French\nphysicist Jean Perrin."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1274, "text": "Along\nwith many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious cathode rays that were known at\nthe time to consist of\nparticles smaller than the smallest atom.

We now know\nthis particle as the\nelectron. Atoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount\nof positive and negative\ncharge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must\ncontain positive charge.

If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an\ninsulator. Most materials are insulators. Their atoms and molecules hold on more tightly to their electrons, so it is\ndifficult for electrons to\nmove between atoms. However, it is not impossible. With enough energy, it is possible to force\nelectrons to move through an\ninsulator. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process. In metals, the outer\nelectrons are loosely bound to\ntheir atoms, so not much energy is required to make electrons move through metal.

Transfer and Separation of Charge\nMost objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of\npositive and negative charge. However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative\ncharge is transferred from\none object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative\ncharge is the mobile charge? The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms\nare stuck in place in\nsolid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms\nor molecules and can\ntherefore be transferred more easily. Electric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is\ncharging by contact, in\nwhich the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1289, "text": "If one of the\nmaterials holds electrons\nmore tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces\ntogether increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present\nfresh material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet\non a dry day, your shoes\nrub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is\nthat you have an excess of\nnegative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons\ntransfer to the neutral\ndoorknob, creating a small spark. Touching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is\ncharging by conduction. This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from\nthe carpet want to be as far\naway from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute\nthemselves over the outer\nsurface of the metal."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1290, "text": "Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of Figure\n18.10.

Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons. The same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge\nessentially cannot move in\nsolids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the\nbottom row of Figure\n18.10. The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess\nprotons, so the second sphere\ntransfers 25 electrons to the first sphere.

In this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand\nto create the spark\nwhen you touched the doorknob. The answer is that no electrons actually traveled from your shoes to\nyour hands. Instead,\nbecause like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of\nthe electrons in your feet.

As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by\nrubbing off onto the\nfloor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is\nagain electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge). The phenomenon of polarization is seen in .

These\nfactors create a resistance\nto the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component\nopposes the flow of\ncharge through it.

Gi) WORK IN PHYSICS\nWhat It Takes to be an Electrical Engineer\nPhysics is used in a wide variety of fields. One field that requires a very thorough knowledge of physics is\nelectrical engineering. An electrical engineer can work on anything from the large-scale power systems that provide power to\nbig cities to the nanoscale\nelectronic circuits that are found in computers and cell phones (Figure 19.13). In working with power companies, you can be responsible for maintaining the power grid that supplies\nelectrical power to large\nareas. Although much of this work is done from an office, it is common to be called in for overtime duty\nafter storms or other\nnatural events.

These jobs can involve much work with\ncomputer simulations and\ncan also involve fields other than electronics.

The only\nconceivable purpose to build\nsuch a submarine was to give the Soviet Union first-strike capability, because this submarine could sneak\nclose to the coast of\nthe United States and fire its ballistic missiles, destroying key military and government installations to\nprevent an American\ncounterattack.

Salt water flows\nthrough a channel that runs from the front to the back of the submarine. A magnetic field is applied\nhorizontally across the\nchannel, and a voltage is applied across the electrodes on the top and bottom of the channel to force a\ndownward electric current\nthrough the water. The charge carriers are the positive sodium ions and the negative chlorine ions of\nsalt. Using the right-hand\nrule, the force on the charge carriers is found to be toward the rear of the vessel. The accelerated\ncharges collide with water\nmolecules and transfer their momentum, creating a jet of water that is propelled out the rear of the\nchannel. By Newton's third\nlaw, the vessel experiences a force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction.

Doing\nthis will make the\nfollowing text more meaningful and will help to remind yourself of some of the key concepts within the\nsection. Understanding Blackbody Graphs\nFigure 21.2 is a plot of radiation intensity against radiated wavelength. In other words, it shows how the\nintensity of radiated\nlight changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature. It may help to just follow the bottom-most red line labeled 3,000 K, red hot. The graph shows that when\na blackbody acquires a\ntemperature of 3,000 K, it radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the energy is\nmost intensely emitted\nat a wavelength of approximately 1000 nm. This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic\nspectrum."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1603, "text": "While a body at this\ntemperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear \u2018infrared-hot\u2019 if we were able to\nsee the entire spectrum. A few other important notes regarding Figure 21.2:\n- As temperature increases, the total amount of energy radiated increases. This is shown by examining\nthe area underneath\neach line. \u00ab Regardless of temperature, all red lines on the graph undergo a consistent pattern. While\nelectromagnetic radiation is\nemitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength. - As the temperature changes, the wavelength of greatest radiation intensity changes. At 4,000 K, the\nradiation is most\nintense in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum. At 6,000 K, the blackbody would radiate white hot,\ndue to intense\nradiation throughout the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remember that white light is\nthe emission of all\nvisible colors simultaneously. - As the temperature increases, the frequency of light providing the greatest intensity increases as well. Recall the equation\nv = fA. Because the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength are inversely related. This is\nverified by the\nleftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1604, "text": "While in science it is important to categorize observations, theorizing as to why the observations exist is\ncrucial to scientific\nadvancement. Why doesn't a blackbody emit radiation evenly across all wavelengths? Why does the\ntemperature of the body\nchange the peak wavelength that is radiated? Why does an increase in temperature cause the peak\nwavelength emitted to\ndecrease? It is questions like these that drove significant research at the turn of the twentieth century. And within the context of\nthese questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance. Planck\u2019s Revolution\nThe prevailing theory at the time of Max Planck\u2019s discovery was that intensity and frequency were\nrelated by the equation\nI= SE . This equation, derived from classical physics and using wave phenomena, infers that as\nwavelength increases, the\nintensity of energy provided will decrease with an inverse-squared relationship. This relationship is\ngraphed in Figure 21.3 and\nshows a troubling trend. For starters, it should be apparent that the graph from this equation does not\nmatch the blackbody\ngraphs found experimentally.

The discord between the predicted classical theory line and the actual results is known as the\nultraviolet catastrophe. Due to concerns over the ultraviolet catastrophe, Max Planck began to question whether another factor\nimpacted the\nrelationship between intensity and wavelength. This factor, he posited, should affect the probability that\nshort wavelength light\nwould be emitted. Should this factor reduce the probability of short wavelength light, it would cause the\nradiance curve to not\nprogress infinitely as in the classical theory, but would instead cause the curve to precipitate back\ndownward as is shown in the\n5,000 K, 4,000 K, and 3,000 K temperature lines of the graph in Figure 21.3."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1606, "text": "Planck noted that this factor,\nwhatever it may be,\nmust also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as\nthe temperature\nincreases.

It would be the basis for Planck\u2019s 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics and\nwould result in the transition\nof physics from classical to modern understanding. In an attempt to determine the cause of the\nprobability factor, Max Planck\nconstructed a new theory. This theory, which created the branch of physics called quantum mechanics,\nspeculated that the\nenergy radiated by the blackbody could exist only in specific numerical, or quantum, states. This theory\nis described by the\nequation FE = nhf, where nis any nonnegative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and his Planck\u2019s constant, given by\nh = 6.626 x 10\u00b0-*4J - s, and fis frequency.

For specified\ntemperatures with specific total energies, it makes sense that more low frequency light would be\nradiated than high frequency\nlight. To a degree, the relationship is like pouring coins through a funnel. More of the smaller pennies\nwould be able to pass\nthrough the funnel than the larger quarters. In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat\nrelated to the size of the\ncoin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced! Furthermore, an increase in temperature would signify the presence of higher energy. As a result, the\ngreater amount of total\nblackbody energy would allow for more of the high frequency, short wavelength, energies to be\nradiated. This permits the peak\nof the blackbody curve to drift leftward as the temperature increases, as it does from the 3,000 K to\n4,000 K to 5,000 K values. Furthering our coin analogy, consider a wider funnel."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1608, "text": "This funnel would permit more quarters to pass\nthrough and allow fora\nreduction in concern about the probability factor. In summary, it is the interplay between the predicted classical model and the quantum probability that\ncreates the curve\ndepicted in Figure 21.3.

However, just as the probability of a quarter passing through a fixed diameter funnel\nis reduced, so is the\nprobability of a high frequency light existing in a fixed temperature object. As is often the case in\nphysics, it is the balancing of\nmultiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding. Quantization\nIt may be helpful at this point to further consider the idea of quantum states. Atoms, molecules, and\nfundamental electron and\nproton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized\u2014that is, they appear only in\ncertain discrete values and\ndo not have every conceivable value.

One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as\nthose that adjust the\nautomatic iris in various types of cameras. Another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your\ncalculator or have seen ona\nrooftop or a roadside sign.

Electrons ejected by\nthe light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the\ncollector wire and plate can then be\nadjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. (credit: P. P.

While often\ntaken for granted, our\nknowledge of the existence and structure of atoms is the result of centuries of contemplation and\nexperimentation. The earliest\nknown speculation on the atom dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Greek philosophers Leucippus\nand Democritus\ncontemplated whether a substance could be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1678, "text": "Since then,\nscientists such as John\nDalton (1766-1844), Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856), and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) helped to\ndiscover the properties of that\nfundamental structure of matter. While much could be written about any number of important scientific\nphilosophers, this\nsection will focus on the role played by Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937). Though his understanding of our\nmost elemental matter is\nrooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the\natom is most\nfundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena. Rutherford\u2019s Experiment\nIn the early 1900\u2019s, the plum pudding model was the accepted model of the atom. Proposed in 1904 by\nJ. J. Thomson, the model\nsuggested that the atom was a spherical ball of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons\nscattered evenly throughout. In that model, the positive charges made up the pudding, while the electrons acted as isolated plums. During its short life, the\nmodel could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number\nof plums, electrically\ncharged atoms could exist. When Ernest Rutherford began his gold foil experiment in 1909, it is unlikely that anyone would have\nexpected that the plum\npudding model would be challenged."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1679, "text": "However, using a radioactive source, a thin sheet of gold foil, and a\nphosphorescent screen,\nRutherford would uncover something so great that he would later call it \u201cthe most incredible event that\nhas ever happened to me\nin my life\u2019[James, L. K. (1993). Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901-1992. Washington, DC: American\nChemical Society.] The experiment that Rutherford designed is shown in Figure 22.2. As you can see in, a radioactive source\nwas placed ina lead\ncontainer with a hole in one side to produce a beam of positively charged helium particles, called alpha\nparticles. Then, a thin\ngold foil sheet was placed in the beam. When the high-energy alpha particles passed through the gold\nfoil, they were scattered. The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor\nscreen. Source of\n@ particles\nFigure 22.2 Rutherford\u2019s experiment gave direct evidence for the size and mass of the nucleus by\nscattering alpha particles from a thin gold\nfoil. The scattering of particles suggests that the gold nuclei are very small and contain nearly all of the\ngold atom\u2019s mass."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1680, "text": "Particularly\nsignificant in showing the size of the nucleus are alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much\nlike a soccer ball bouncing off a\ngoalie\u2019s head. The expectation of the plum pudding model was that the high-energy alpha particles would be scattered\nonly slightly by the\npresence of the gold sheet. Because the energy of the alpha particles was much higher than those\ntypically associated with\natoms, the alpha particles should have passed through the thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball\nwould crash through a\nfew dozen rows of bowling pins. Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the\nelectrostatic Coulomb force\nbetween the alpha particles and the foil\u2019s interior electric charges. However, the true result was nothing of the sort. While the majority of alpha particles passed through\nthe foil unobstructed,\nRutherford and his collaborators Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden found that alpha particles\noccasionally were scattered to\nlarge angles, and some even came back in the direction from which they came! The result, called\nRutherford scattering, implied\nthat the gold nuclei were actually very small when compared with the size of the gold atom."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1681, "text": "As shown in\nFigure 22.3, the dense\nnucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in\n8,000 particles was scattered\nbackward.

Most\nalpha particles crash through but are\nrelatively unaffected because of their high energy and the electron\u2019s small mass. Some, however, strike\na nucleus and are scattered straight\nback. A detailed analysis of their interaction gives the size and mass of the nucleus. Although the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two\nyears to convince himself\nof their meaning. Rutherford later wrote: \u201cIt was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a\npiece of tissue paper and\nit came back and hit you."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1682, "text": "On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ...

As a result of the paper, the size\nof the nucleus was\ndetermined to be about 107\u00b0 m, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. That implies a huge density, on\nthe order of 10\" g/\ncm}?, much greater than any macroscopic matter. Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons,\nRutherford proposed the\nplanetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a\nlarge-mass nucleus. The\nsizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, and most of the atom is a\nvacuum. The model is\nanalogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun.

Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the\npitchblende was emitting the\ninvisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of\nconservation of energy,\none that scientists can now explain using Einstein's famous equation E = mc\u201d. It was soon evident that\nBecquerel\u2019s rays\noriginate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.

First, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether\nuranium was in the form of\nan element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1717, "text": "In addition, the presence of radiation does not\nvary with temperature,\npressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom,\nthe radiation cannot\ncome from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be\natomic. Nuclear\nradiation has energies on the order of 10\u00b0 eV per event, which is much greater than typical atomic\nenergies that are a few eV,\nsuch as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most\nenergetic X-rays. But why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable\nstructure to begin emitting\nenergy? Was there something special about Becquerel\u2019s uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those\nquestions, it is necessary to\nlook into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the\nsame principles that we\nobserve on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.

The strong force has such a short range that it quickly\nfall to zero over a distance\nof only 10\u00b0* meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.

Beta Decay\nLike alpha decay, beta ( 3) decay also takes place when there is an imbalance between neutrons and\nprotons within the nucleus.

Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the\nbiosphere, where it is\nconsumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per\ntrillion of normal carbon, so\nif you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro\u2019s\nnumber), you can multiply\nthat number by 1.3 x 107!\u201d to find the number of '*C nuclei within the object.

Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of\nmanipulating the atom to\nrelease its internal energy. Nuclear Fission\nIn simplest terms, nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond.

An unstable atom will naturally decay, but it may take millions of years to do so. As a result, a physical\ncatalyst is necessary to\nproduce useful energy through nuclear fission. The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free\nneutron, projected directly at\nthe nucleus of a high-mass atom. As shown in Figure 22.26, a neutron strike can cause the nucleus to elongate, much like a drop of liquid\nwater. This is why the\nmodel is known as the liquid drop model. As the nucleus elongates, nucleons are no longer so tightly\npacked, and the repulsive\nelectromagnetic force can overcome the short-range strong nuclear force. The imbalance of forces can\nresult in the two ends of\nthe drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings. ~\n(d)\nFigure 22.26 Neutron-induced fission is shown.

As you can imagine, the consequences of the nuclei splitting are substantial. When a nucleus is split, it is\nnot only energy that is\nreleased, but a small number of neutrons as well. Those neutrons have the potential to cause further\nfission in other nuclei,\nespecially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see\npart (d) of Figure 22.26). However, not every neutron produced by fission induces further fission. Some neutrons escape the\nfissionable material, while\nothers interact with a nucleus without making it split. We can enhance the number of fissions produced\nby neutrons by having a\nlarge amount of fissionable material as well as a neutron reflector. The minimum amount necessary for\nself-sustained fission of\na given nuclide is called its critical mass. Some nuclides, such as *7\u00b0Pu, produce more neutrons per\nfission than others, such as\n235, Additionally, some nuclides are easier to make fission than others.

This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average\nfission and how easy it is to make a\nparticular type of nuclide fission. A chain reaction can have runaway results. If each atomic split results in two nuclei producing a new\nfission, the number of\nnuclear reactions will increase exponentially. One fission will produce two atoms, the next round of\nfission will create four\natoms, the third round eight atoms, and so on. Of course, each time fission occurs, more energy will be\nemitted, further\nincreasing the power of the atomic reaction. And that is just if two neutrons create fission reactions\neach round.

Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules\ncontaining chemical\npatterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage\nto DNA consists of breaks\nin chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the\ngenetic code. In\nhuman cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA\nis vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire\norganism.

Cancer is\ncharacterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There\nis no contradiction to\nsay that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause. Radiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are\nmore sensitive to\nradiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible\nwhile limiting the dose for\nnormal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all\nradiotherapy\ntechniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a\nnumber of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure\n22.41. A narrow beam of\nradiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the\ntumor."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1774, "text": "The technique\nconcentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.

This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors. Another use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are\nused in cancer therapy by\ntagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded\nwith a radioisotope,\nand then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue\nthey developed to fight, thus\nlocalizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid\ncancer. While the\ntherapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for\norgans that eliminate\nradiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder.

Understanding the Four Forces\nThe gravitational force is most familiar to us because it describes so many of our common observations. It explains why a\ndropped ball falls to the ground and why our planet orbits the Sun. It gives us the property of weight and\ndetermines much\nabout the motion of objects in our daily lives. Because gravitational force acts between all objects of\nmass and has the ability to\nact over large distances, the gravitational force can be used to explain much of what we observe and can\neven describe the\nmotion of objects on astronomical scales! That said, gravity is incredibly weak compared to the other\nfundamental forces and is\nthe weakest of all of the fundamental forces. Consider this: The entire mass of Earth is needed to hold\nan iron nail to the ground. Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward\nthrough space. The electromagnetic force is responsible for both electrostatic interactions and the magnetic force seen\nbetween bar magnets."}, {"file": "About Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 1806, "text": "When focusing on the electrostatic relationship between two charged particles, the electromagnetic\nforce is known as the\ncoulomb force.

The strong nuclear force is an attractive force that exists between all nucleons. This force, which acts\nequally between proton-\nproton connections, proton-neutron connections, and neutron-neutron connections, is the strongest of\nall forces at short\nranges. However, at a distance of 10\u201d cm, or the diameter of a single proton, the force dissipates to\nzero. If the nucleus is large\n(it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the\ndiameter of a single proton.

SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHING THE SYLLABUS\nThe syllabus is presented in a teaching sequence. However, the teacher may change the teaching order in a particular year provided the linkage between the\nsections and the respective units is maintained and the syllabus for the year completed by the end of each year. It is important that classroom teaching be\nsupplemented with field trips wherever appropriate. Besides the above advice, the teacher\u201fs attention is drawn to some new concepts that have been introduced in this syllabus to help improve instructional\ndelivery and learning.

The general objectives specify the skills and behaviours students should acquire by the\nend instruction in the units of a section. Read the general objectives very carefully before you start teaching the section. After teaching all the units of the\nsection, go back and read the general objectives again to be sure you have covered the objectives adequately in the course of your teaching. Sections and Units:\nThe syllabus has been planned on the basis of Sections and Units. Each year\u201fs work is divided into sections. A section consists of a fairly homogeneous body\nof knowledge within the subject. Within each section are units. A unit consists of a more related and homogeneous body of knowledge and skills. Columns\nThe syllabus is structured in five columns: Units, Specific Objectives, Content, Teaching and Learning Activities and Evaluation. A description of the contents\nof each column is as follows:\nv\nColumn 1 - Units: The units in Column 1 are divisions of the major topics of the section. You are expected to follow the unit topics according to the linear order\nin which they have been presented."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 8, "text": "However, if you find at some point that teaching and learning in your class will be more effective if you branched to another\nunit before coming back to the unit in the sequence, you are encouraged to do so. Column 2 - Specific Objectives: Column 2 shows the Specific Objectives for each unit. The specific objectives begin with numbers such as 1.3.5 or 2.1.1. These numbers are referred to as \u201cSyllabus Reference Numbers\u201d. The first digit in the syllabus reference number refers to the section; the second digit refers to\nthe unit, while the third digit refers to the rank order of the specific objective. For instance, 1.3.5 means: Section 1, Unit 3 (of Section 1) and Specific Objective\n5. In other words, 1.3.5 refers to Specific Objective 5 of Unit 3 of Section 1. Similarly, the syllabus reference number 2.1.1 simply means Specific Objective\nnumber 1 of Unit 1 of Section 2. Using syllabus reference numbers provide an easy way for communication among teachers and other educators. It further\nprovides an easy way for selecting objectives for test construction.

You are encouraged to re-order the suggested teaching and learning\nactivities and also add to them where necessary in order to achieve optimum student learning. As we have implied already, the major purpose of teaching and\nlearning is to make students able to apply their knowledge in dealing with issues both in and out of school. A suggestion that will help your students acquire the\nhabit of analytical thinking and the capacity for applying their knowledge to problems is to begin each lesson with a practical problem. Select a practical problem\nfor each lesson. The selection must be made such that students can use knowledge gained in the previous lesson and other types of information not specifically\ntaught in class."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 11, "text": "At the beginning of a lesson, state the problem, or write the problem on the board.

The emphasis is to assist your students to develop analytical thinking and practical problem solving techniques. Column 5 - Evaluation: Suggestions and exercises for evaluating the lessons of each unit are indicated in Column 5. Evaluation exercises can be in the form\nof oral questions, quizzes, class assignments, essays, structured questions, project work etc. Try to ask questions and set tasks and assignments that will\nchallenge your students to apply their knowledge to issues and problems as we have already said above, and that will engage them in developing solutions,\nand positive scientific attitudes as a result of having undergone instruction in this subject. The suggested evaluation tasks are not exhaustive.

Similarly, being able to develop, plan, construct\netc. means that the student can \u201capply\u201d the knowledge acquired in some new context. You will note that each of the specific objectives in this syllabus contains\nan \u201caction verb\u201d that describes the behaviour the student will be able to demonstrate after the instruction. \u201cKnowledge\u201d, \u201cApplication\u201d etc."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 13, "text": "are dimensions that\nshould be the prime focus of teaching and learning in schools.

It is therefore, necessary that you develop a scheme of work and\nlesson plans for teaching the units of this syllabus. DEFINITION OF PROFILE DIMENSIONS\nAs already stated, profile dimensions describe the underlying behaviours for teaching, learning and assessment. In Physics, the three profile dimensions that\nhave been specified for teaching, learning and testing are:\nKnowledge and Understanding 30%\nApplication of Knowledge 40%\nPractical and Experimental Skills 30%\nEach of the dimensions has been given a percentage weight that should be reflected in teaching, learning and testing. The weights, indicated on the right of the\ndimensions, show the relative emphasis that the teacher should give in the teaching, learning and testing processes."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 14, "text": "The focus of this syllabus is to get\nstudents not only to acquire knowledge but also be able to understand what they have learnt and apply them practically. Combining the three dimensions in\nyour teaching will ensure that Physics is taught not only at the factual knowledge level but that students will also acquire the ability to apply scientific knowledge\nto issues and problems, and will also acquire the capacity for practical and experimental skills that are needed for scientific problem solving. The explanation of\nthe dimensions and the key action verbs associated with each profile dimension are as follows:\nKnowledge and Understanding (KU)\nKnowledge The ability to:\nRemember, recognize, retrieve, locate, find, do bullet pointing, highlight, bookmark, network socially, bookmark socially, search,\ngoogle, favourite, recall, identify, define, describe, list, name, match, state principles, facts and concepts. Knowledge is simply the\nability to remember or recall material already learned and constitutes the lowest level of learning. Understanding The ability to:\nInterpret, explain, infer, compare, explain, exemplify, do advanced searches, categorize, comment, twitter, tag, annotate, subscribe,\nsummarize, translate, rewrite, paraphrase, give examples, generalize, estimate or predict consequences based upon a trend."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 15, "text": "Understanding is generally the ability to grasp the meaning of some material that may be verbal, pictorial, or symbolic. vii\nApplication of Knowledge (AK)\nThe ability to use knowledge or apply knowledge, as implied in this syllabus, has a number of learning/behaviour levels. These levels include application,\nanalysis, innovation or creativity, and evaluation. These may be considered and taught separately, paying attention to reflect each of them equally in your\nteaching. The dimension \u201cApplying Knowledge\u201d is a summary dimension for all four learning levels. Details of each of the four sub levels are as follows:\nApplication The ability to:\nApply rules, methods, principles, theories, etc. to concrete situations that are new and unfamiliar. It also involves the ability to produce,\nsolve, operate, demonstrate, discover, implement, carry out, use, execute, run, load, play, hack, upload, share, edit etc. Analysis The ability to:\nBreak down a piece of material into its component parts, to differentiate, compare, deconstruct, attribute, outline, find, structure,\nintegrate, mash, link, validate, crack, distinguish, separate, identify significant points etc., recognize unstated assumptions and logical\nfallacies, recognize inferences from facts etc. Analytical ability underlies discriminate thinking."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 16, "text": "Innovation/Creativity The ability to:\nPut parts together to form a new whole, a novel, coherent whole or make an original product. It involves the ability to synthesize,\ncombine, compile, compose, devise, construct, plan, produce, invent, devise, make, program, film, animate, mix, re-mix, publish, video\ncast, podcast, direct, broadcast, suggest an idea or possible ways, revise, design, organize, create, and generate new ideas and\nsolutions. The ability to create or innovate is the highest form of learning. The world becomes more comfortable because some people,\nbased on their learning, generate new ideas, design and create new things. Evaluating The ability to:\nAppraise, compare features of different things and make comments or judgement, contrast, critique, justify, hypothesize, experiment,\ntest, detect, monitor, review, post, moderate, collaborate, network, refractor, support, discuss, conclude, make recommendations etc. Evaluation refers to the ability to judge the worth or value of some material based on some criteria and standards. We generally\ncompare, appraise and select throughout the day. Every decision we make involves evaluation. Evaluation is a high level ability just as\napplication, analysis and innovation or creativity since it goes beyond simple knowledge acquisition and understanding."}, {"file": "elective-physics-syallbus-14-10-10.pdf", "chunk_idx": 17, "text": "A number of examination questions at the secondary school level begin with the word \u201cDiscuss\u201d. Discuss belongs to the evaluation thinking skill and implies the\nability to analyze, compare, contrast, make a judgement etc. The word \u201cdiscuss\u201d asks for a variety of thinking skills and is obviously a higher order thinking\nbehaviour. Students consequently do poorly on examination questions that start with \u201cDiscuss\u201d. For this reason, and also for the reason that discussion of\nissues, discussion of reports etc., are some of the major intellectual activities students will be engaged in, in work situations and at higher levels of learning after\nthey have left secondary school, it will be very helpful if you would emphasize discussion questions etc. both in class and in the tests you set. PRACTICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SKILLS (PES)\nThe Practical and Experimental Skills involve the demonstration of the inquiry processes in science and refer to skills in planning and designing of experiments,\nobservation, manipulation, classification, drawing, measurement, interpretation, recording, reporting, and conduct in the laboratory/field.

End-of-Tem Examination: The end-of-term test is a summative assessment system and should consist of the knowledge and skills students have\nacquired in the term. The end-of-term test for Term 3 for example, should be composed of items/questions based on the specific objectives studied over\nthe three terms, using a different weighting system such as to reflect the importance of the work done in each term in appropriate proportions. For\nexample, a teacher may build an End-of-Term 3 test in such a way that it would consist of the 20% of the objectives studied in Term 1, 20% of\nobjectives studied in Term 2 and 60% of the objectives studied in Term 3.

This will\nprepare learners to live a responsible adult life, further their education and enter the world of work. This is the first time that Ghana has developed an SHS Curriculum which focuses on national values,\nattempting to educate a generation of Ghanaian youth who are proud of our country and can contribute\neffectively to its development. This Teacher Manual for Physics covers all aspects of the content, pedagogy, teaching and learning\nresources and assessment required to effectively teach Year One of the new curriculum. It contains\nthis information for the first 12 weeks of Year One, with the remaining 12 weeks contained within\nBook Two. Teachers are therefore to use this Teacher Manual to develop their weekly Learning Plans\nas required by Ghana Education Service. Some of the key features of the new curriculum are set out below. Learner-Centred Curriculum\nThe SHS, SHTS, and STEM curriculum places the learner at the center of teaching and learning by\nbuilding on their existing life experiences, knowledge and understanding."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 4, "text": "Learners are actively\ninvolved in the knowledge-creation process, with the teacher acting as a facilitator. This involves\nusing interactive and practical teaching and learning methods, as well as the learner\u2019s environment\nto make learning exciting and relatable. As an example, the new curriculum focuses on Ghanaian\nculture, Ghanaian history, and Ghanaian geography so that learners first understand their home and\nsurroundings before extending their knowledge globally. Promoting Ghanaian Values\nShared Ghanaian values have been integrated into the curriculum to ensure that all young people\nunderstand what it means to be a responsible Ghanaian citizen. These values include truth, integrity,\ndiversity, equity, self-directed learning, self-confidence, adaptability and resourcefulness, leadership\nand responsible citizenship. Integrating 21st Century Skills and Competencies\nThe SHS, SHTS, and STEM curriculum integrates 21st Century skills and competencies."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 5, "text": "These are:\n\u2022 Foundational Knowledge: Literacy, Numeracy, Scientific Literacy, Information\nCommunication and Digital Literacy, Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship, Cultural\nIdentity, Civic Literacy and Global Citizenship\n\u2022 Competencies: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Innovation and Creativity, Collaboration\nand Communication\n\u2022 Character Qualities: Discipline and Integrity, Self-Directed Learning, Self-Confidence,\nAdaptability and Resourcefulness, Leadership and Responsible Citizenship\nBalanced Approach to Assessment - not just Final External Examinations\nThe SHS, SHTS, and STEM curriculum promotes a balanced approach to assessment. It encourages\nvaried and differentiated assessments such as project work, practical demonstration, performance\nassessment, skills-based assessment, class exercises, portfolios as well as end-of-term examinations\nand final external assessment examinations. Two levels of assessment are used. These are:\n1\nIntroduction\n\u2022 Internal Assessment (30%) \u2013 Comprises formative (portfolios, performance and project work)\nand summative (end-of-term examinations) which will be recorded in a school-based transcript. \u2022 External Assessment (70%) \u2013 Comprehensive summative assessment will be conducted by the\nWest African Examinations Council (WAEC) through the WASSCE. The questions posed by\nWAEC will test critical thinking, communication and problem solving as well as knowledge,\nunderstanding and factual recall. The split of external and internal assessment will remain at 70/30 as is currently the case."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 6, "text": "However,\nthere will be far greater transparency and quality assurance of the 30% of marks which are school-\nbased. This will be achieved through the introduction of a school-based transcript, setting out all\nmarks which learners achieve from SHS 1 to SHS 3. This transcript will be presented to universities\nalongside the WASSCE certificate for tertiary admissions. An Inclusive and Responsive Curriculum\nThe SHS, SHTS, and STEM curriculum ensures no learner is left behind, and this is achieved through\nthe following:\n\u2022 Addressing the needs of all learners, including those requiring additional support or with special\nneeds. The SHS, SHTS, and STEM curriculum includes learners with disabilities by adapting\nteaching and learning materials into accessible formats through technology and other measures\nto meet the needs of learners with disabilities. \u2022 Incorporating strategies and measures, such as differentiation and adaptative pedagogies\nensuring equitable access to resources and opportunities for all learners. \u2022 Challenging traditional gender, cultural, or social stereotypes and encouraging all learners to\nachieve their true potential. \u2022 Making provision for the needs of gifted and talented learners in schools."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 7, "text": "Social and Emotional Learning\nSocial and emotional learning skills have also been integrated into the curriculum to help learners to\ndevelop and acquire skills, attitudes, and knowledge essential for understanding and managing their\nemotions, building healthy relationships and making responsible decisions. Philosophy and vision for each subject\nEach subject now has its own philosophy and vision, which sets out why the subject is being taught\nand how it will contribute to national development. The Philosophy and Vision for Physics is:\nPhilosophy: The next generation of scientists is empowered through critical and creative thinking\nby understanding the theoretical and practical application of related concepts in physics that leverage\nhands-on activities within a global environment\nVision: To equip physics learners with 21st century skills and competencies through hands-on\nexperimentation, analysis and discovery of basic concepts in physics and science for sustainable\ndevelopment. 2\nAcknowledgements\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nSpecial thanks to Professor Edward Appiah, Director-General of the National Council for Curriculum\nand Assessment (NaCCA) and all who contributed to the successful writing of the Teacher Manuals for\nthe new Senior High School (SHS), Senior High Technical School (SHTS) and Science Technology,\nEngineering and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 8, "text": "The writing team was made up of the following members:\nSubject Writer Institution\nHome Economics Grace Annagmeng Mwini Tumu College of Education\nImoro Miftaw Gambaga Girls\u2019 SHS\nLove Boateng Juaso SHS\nJusinta Kwakyewaa (Rev."}, {"file": "Physics.pdf", "chunk_idx": 9, "text": "Sr.) St. Francis SHTS\nReligious Studies Richardson Addai-Mununkum University of Education Winneba\nDr. Bonsu Osei-Owusu West Africa SHS\nPrince Osei Adjei Adventist SHS, Bantama\nDr Francis Opoku Valley View University College\nYaw Sarkodie Agyemang University of Cape Coast\nAransa Bawa Abdul Razak Uthmaniya SHS\nGodfred Bonsu Prempeh College\nRME Anthony Mensah Abetifi College of Education\nJoseph Bless Darkwa Volo Community SHS\nClement Nsorwineh Atigah Tamale SHS\nArabic Murtada Mahmoud Muaz AAMUSTED\nAbas Umar Mohammed University of Ghana\nAdam Abubakar Uthmaniya SHS\nMahey Ibrahim Mohammed Tijjaniya Senior High School\nFrench Osmanu Ibrahim Mount Mary College of Education\nMaurice Adjetey\nMawufemor Kwame Agorgli Akim Asafo SHS\nPerforming Arts Latipher Osei Appiah-Agyei University of Education Winneba\nDesmond Ali Gasanga Ghana Education Service\nYaw Owusu Asiamah Adventist SHS, Bantama\nChris Ampomah Mensah Bolgatanga SHS, Winkogo\n3\nAcknowledgements\nSubject Writer Institution\nArt and Design Dr. Ebenezer Acquah University for Education Winneba\nStudio and\nDr. Osuanyi Quaicoo Essel University for Education Winneba\nFoundation\nSeyram Kojo Adipah Ghana Education Service\nJectey Nyarko Mantey Kwame Nkrumah University of\nScience and Technology\nYaw Boateng Ampadu Prempeh College\nKwame Opoku Bonsu Kwame Nkrumah University of\nScience and Technology\nDzorka Etonam Justice Kpando SHS\nApplied Joseph Asomani AAMUSTED\nTechnology\nDr. Prosper Mensah AAMUSTED\n& Design and\nCommunication Dr. Sherry Kwabla Amedorme AAMUSTED\nTechnology\nEsther Pokuah Mampong Technical College of\nEducation\nWisdom Dzidzienyo Adzraku AAMUSTED\nKunkyuuri Philip Kumasi SHTS\nAntwi Samuel Kibi SHTS\nGabriel Boafo Kwabeng Anglican SHTS\nJosiah Bawagigah Kandwe Walewale Technical Institute\nEmmanuel Korletey Benso SHTS\nIsaac Buckman Armed Forces SHTS\nDaniel K.

SUMMARY OF PEDAGOGICAL EXEMPLARS\nThe topics in Section 1 lend themselves to a variety of teaching methods, including:\n- Discussions in pairs or groups in order to allow students to build on one another\u2019s\u2019\nunderstanding or consider concepts from a different perspective, e.g. \u2022 Which career they would be interested in pursuing and why? Invite guest speakers from relevant\nindustries to share their career experiences and insights. - Where possible, engage learners through hands-on activities and inquiry-based learning. Where this is not possible, photographs and videos of the demonstrations should be\nshown. E.g. \u2022 Identify and measure basic physical quantities using standard units (e.g., meter, kilogram, second). \u2022 Demonstrate proper use of measurement tools (e.g., meter rule, vernier calliper) and common\nerrors that may occur.
